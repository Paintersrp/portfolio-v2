## Side Note

Unforunately this project was using PlanetScale, who recently shutdown their free tier, so I will have to go back and do some refactoring before it's back online. I will eventually migrate this to run off of one of my linode instances which can host it's own Postgres server.

### Overview

Hivemind is an innovative platform designed to mirror the dynamic and diverse nature of Reddit's community interaction. With a focus on user-friendly design and robust functionality, Hivemind stands as a modern interpretation of a forum, enhanced by the latest advancements in web development.

The backbone of Hivemind is its tech stack, which includes NextJS for server-side rendering and static site generation, AWS for scalable cloud infrastructure, MySQL for a reliable database solution, and Prisma for efficient database management. This combination ensures a resilient and flexible architecture that can handle the ebb and flow of community engagement.
