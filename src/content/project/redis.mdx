### Overview

This project is a custom implementation of Redis, a popular open-source in-memory data structure store, built entirely in Go. Redis is widely used as a database, cache, and message broker, and this implementation aims to provide a high-performance, thread-safe solution for handling in-memory data structures.

The core functionality includes support for various data structures such as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. Additionally, the implementation features advanced capabilities like pub/sub messaging, transactions, and persistence options.

### Features

- **High-Performance**: Leveraging Go's concurrency features and efficient memory management, this implementation delivers lightning-fast performance for handling in-memory data structures.
- **Thread Safety**: The implementation ensures thread safety, allowing multiple clients to access and modify data concurrently without risking data corruption or race conditions.
- **TCP Networking**: The Redis protocol is implemented over TCP networking, enabling clients to connect and interact with the server remotely.
- **Data Persistence**: Various persistence options are available, including snapshotting and append-only file (AOF) logging, ensuring data durability across server restarts.
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: The implementation supports Redis' pub/sub messaging system, enabling real-time communication between publishers and subscribers.
